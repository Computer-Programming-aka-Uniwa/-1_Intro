## Assignment Title
**Title**: Basic Arithmetic Operations with Integers in C

## Description
This assignment demonstrates a simple C program that performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) using integers. The project also explores common syntax and logic errors that can occur during program development and execution.

The program helps users understand:
- How to develop and run a C program
- Error handling during program development (syntax, logic, runtime errors)
- Basic input/output operations in C

### Theory Topics Covered:
1. **What is a Program?**
2. **Steps to Develop and Execute a C Program**
   - Editing
   - Saving the Program
   - Compilation
   - Linking
   - Executing the Program
3. **General Categories of Program Errors**:
   - Syntax Errors
   - Logical Errors
   - Runtime Errors

### Source Code:
The program implements basic arithmetic operations and highlights potential syntax and logical errors. Both the erroneous (`C1aWrong.c`) and the corrected (`C1aCorrect.c`) versions of the code are provided to help understand how common mistakes can be fixed.

## Requirements
- **C Compiler**: GCC or any C compiler
- **Operating System**: Linux/Windows/MacOS
- **Development Environment**: Command Line / IDE
